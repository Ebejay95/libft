**The basic ingredients for any upcoming C project.**

The project contains imitations of system functions and additional tools. They are organized in different folders for better overview as follows:

- **MATH:** Functions for basic mathematical operations like absolute value, checking if a number is even or odd, and finding the greatest common divisor.
- **MEMORY:** Includes functions for memory management such as custom dynamic memory allocation, memory comparison, and safe memory copying.
- **STRING:** Provides a suite of functions for string manipulation, including custom implementations of common string functions like strcpy, strcat, and more.
- **PRINTS:** Functions for outputting different types of data to the console, which include customized print functions for different data types.
- **LISTS:** Functions to manage linked lists and doubly linked lists, offering operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **CONVERTER:** Includes functions to convert between different data types or formats, such as integer to string conversion.
- **FILE_HANDLING:** Provides a set of functions to handle file operations, which could include opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- **NETWORK:** Contains basic network functions for creating and managing connections, sending and receiving data.
- **ANALYZER:** Functions to analyze and check characteristics of characters and strings, such as whether a character is alphanumeric or not.
- **HELPERSHIT:** Additional helper functions that assist in the operations of the library, enhancing functionality and easing common tasks.
